If you want to customize the tabla styles to suit your preferences, you can use the [STYLE CREATOR] function of your keyboard. This function allows you to edit the style parameters, such as tempo, volume, voice, variation, etc. You can also record your own patterns using the keyboard's pads or keys. To access the [STYLE CREATOR] function, press the [FUNCTION] button and then press [I]. Follow the instructions on the display to edit or create your own tabla styles.
 
Another way to enhance your musical performance with tabla sounds is to use the [SPLIT] function of your keyboard. This function allows you to split the keyboard into two sections, each with a different voice. You can assign a tabla voice to one section and a melodic voice to another section. This way, you can play both the melody and the rhythm with your keyboard. To use the [SPLIT] function, press the [SPLIT] button and then use the [VOICE] buttons to select the voices for each section. You can adjust the split point using the [+/YES] and [-/NO] buttons.

You can use them for various genres and occasions, such as classical concerts, devotional services, folk festivals, or pop gigs. With your Yamaha PSR 550 keyboard and these free tabla styles, you can explore and enjoy the rich and diverse musical culture of India.
